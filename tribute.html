        <h3>Main Characteristics of Aikido</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>It is a defensive-minded martial art</li>
          <li>Aikido has been developed by Ueshiba Morihei in Japan from 1940s to 1960s</li>
          <li>During training we handle agressive actions by not hurting the attacker</li>
          <li>Aikido builds on circular movement and the defending person uses the energy of the attacker</li>
          <li>In Aikido there aren't any competitions</li>
          <li>The aim is to improve yourself and help to improve others during training</li>
          <li>There are grades in Aikido: from 8-1 kyu, then from 1-10 dan</li>
          <li>You either have white or black belt but some schools use other colours as well</li>
          <li>Aikido is called sometimes the Art of Peace or Art of Harmony</li>
          <li>The goal is to be able to manage multiple attackers and divert their agressive energy</li>
          <li>This can be done through throws, locks and clamps</li>
          <li>The real goal is to be healthy, have a peace in your life and maintain good physical condition</li>
          <li>Aikido trainings should be fun, not just struggling. The key is continuous practice</li>
          <li>We use wooden weapons as well: sword, stick and knife</li>
        </ul>

          <li>Response time is improving</li>
          <li>Every single part of the body is included in the movements</li>
